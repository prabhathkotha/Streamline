# Streamline

This project offers a webapp to help users navigate the decision to buy into a streaming service. 

The current streaming service market is flooded with alternatives making it hard to decide if a given service will be entertaining _to you_. Thankfully, services tend to specialize in ways that make them a _best choice_ for users. Our job is answer that question for you.

Our _"backend"_ will periodically run report_card.js to update our reportCards.json resource. The accuracy of this resource is integral to providing accurate user recommendations.

We collect the data that users input during the survey to show trends in user preference. The data can be used to improve our recommendation methodology through A/B testing to achieve the highest referral rate using affiliate links. These affiliations will be a primary source of revenue for the site.
